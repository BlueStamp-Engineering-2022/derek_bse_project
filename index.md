# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was finishing up my project. I finished the programming for my ir sensors and fixed up my issue with the robot's back wheel. Matthew helped me raise up the wheel using spacers. I programmed the sensors to tell the robot to move backward and turn left when it did not detect the table. Otherwise, if the sensor did detect the table, the robot would continue to move forward. A lot of my wires popped again so I had to reinstall them. I ziptied the wires so that they wouldn't get caught on anything, such as the wheels.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was putting together all my hardware and programming my motors. I installed my arduino and the rest of my circuitry, as well as my motors. I had the most fun with this process because I'm pretty big on mechanical engineering. I struggled the most, however, with the electrical engineering aspect of my robot. The wiring was really difficult and I hit a lot of blocks. I also had to brainstorm where to install my battery box because the box I received didn't fit in the area of space that was designated for it in the instructions. Afterwards, I programmed my motors with arduino.

# Starter Project; Larson Scanner
On my first day, I was almost able to finish my starter project but I accidentally soldered my microcontroller wrong so I had to restart. But I was still able to make some progress in my project once I started over. I learned to pay more attention and be more diligent when soldering. I also learned to not rush as much. On the second day, I finished my starter project entirely. I did the optional challenge and soldered my LEDs at different heights. I Learned to be more patient and to take my time when working.
